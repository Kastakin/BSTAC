# Examples

This folder contains the following files:

- `input_legend.inp` is an exhaustive file specification for the input of BSTAC. It should not be run as it is not an input file itself.

- `H6Lk` is an example of titration for a generic and theoretical hexaprotic acid, at fixed ionic strength and with 6 input titrations as targets for the optimization.
